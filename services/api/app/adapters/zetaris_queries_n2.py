"""Named queries owned by the engines lane (nexus-2), merged into NAMED_QUERIES by adapters/zetaris.py.

Split agreed with nexus-1 (data lane), who owns adapters/zetaris.py and the core registry.
Each query has a Lightning SQL form (Zetaris, schema `nexus`) and a DuckDB twin over the sample
bundle (data/sample/views.sql defines the same view names), and declares its output columns.

Lists come back as comma-joined strings in both forms (Spark `concat_ws(collect_list)`, DuckDB
`string_agg`), so the two return identical shapes.
